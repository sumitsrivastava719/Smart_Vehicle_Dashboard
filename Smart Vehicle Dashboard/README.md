Smart Vehicle Dashboard using CAN Bus & IoT
A Dual-Microcontroller Real-Time Automotive Monitoring System

This project implements a smart vehicle dashboard capable of acquiring, transmitting, visualizing, and remotely monitoring real-time vehicle and environmental parameters. It uses STM32F407VGT6, ESP32, CAN bus, and FreeRTOS, along with multiple sensors to replicate the workflow of a modern automotive dashboard.

🔧 System Overview

The system follows a dual-MCU architecture for modularity and reliability:

1. STM32F407VGT6 (Primary Controller)

Handles all real-time sensor acquisition

Runs multiple FreeRTOS tasks

Transmits processed data to ESP32 via CAN bus

2. ESP32-WROOM-32 (Secondary Controller)

Receives CAN frames from STM32

Collects additional environmental data

Renders a full dashboard on an OLED display

Uploads consolidated data to Blynk Cloud for remote monitoring

📡 Sensors Used & Their Purpose
Sensors connected to STM32
Sensor	Purpose
LM35	Measures engine/ambient temperature (analog).
HC-SR04 Ultrasonic	Measures obstacle distance (2–400 cm).
HC-89 IR Speed Sensor	Measures rotational speed (RPM) for vehicle speed.
MPU6050	Detects jerk, tilt, or sudden acceleration changes.
Sensors connected to ESP32
Sensor	Purpose
DHT11	Measures cabin temperature and humidity.
MQ-135	Measures air quality (CO₂, NH₃, NOx, smoke, pollutants).
NEO-6M GPS	Provides live coordinates, speed, and satellite data.
SSD1306 OLED	Displays real-time dashboard metrics.
🖧 Communication & Interfaces
CAN Bus (STM32 ↔ ESP32)

Used for high-reliability data transmission between microcontrollers.
CAN Frame IDs used:

0x100 – Temperature

0x101 – Distance

0x102 – Jerk Detection

0x103 – Speed

Other Interfaces

ADC → LM35, MQ-135

I2C → OLED, MPU6050

UART → GPS

Digital GPIO → Ultrasonic, DHT11, HC-89

⚙️ FreeRTOS Task Architecture
STM32 FreeRTOS Tasks

🔄 System Workflow

STM32 continuously reads all connected sensors using FreeRTOS tasks.

STM32 packages values into CAN frames and sends them to ESP32.

ESP32 reads its own sensors (DHT11, MQ-135, GPS).

ESP32 merges both data streams and displays them on the OLED.

ESP32 uploads full dashboard data to Blynk Cloud over Wi-Fi.
